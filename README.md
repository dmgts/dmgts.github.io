## Project Overview
Welcome to my professional portfolio page, hosted here on GitHub. This portfolio showcases my journey and achievements in Data Analytics. It's designed to highlight my projects, skills, and professional milestones. Built with HTML and CSS, I've utilized templates from [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/) as a foundation, modifying and enhancing them to suit my unique professional narrative and aesthetic preferences.

## Motivation
The inspiration behind creating this portfolio was to have a centralized platform where I could share my work, insights, and professional journey with peers, potential employers, and the broader community. My goal was to not only showcase my accomplishments but also reflect my growth and the diverse skill set I've developed over the years.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and layout of the portfolio.
- **CSS3**: For styling and visually enhancing the site.
- **Jekyll**: Utilized for template integration and site customization.

## Usage
The portfolio is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. It's divided into sections showcasing my projects, skills, and professional experiences. Visitors can easily browse through my work, read about my professional journey, and get in touch with me for collaboration or inquiries.


## Credits and Acknowledgments
