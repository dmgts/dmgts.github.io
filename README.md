## Project Overview
Welcome to my professional portfolio page, hosted here on GitHub. This portfolio showcases my journey and achievements in Data Analytics. It's designed to highlight my projects, skills, and professional milestones. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I've utilized templates from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) as a foundation, modifying and enhancing them to suit my professional narrative and aesthetic preferences.

## Motivation
The inspiration behind creating this portfolio was to have a centralized platform where I could share my work, insights, and professional journey with peers, potential employers, and the broader community. My goal was to not only showcase my accomplishments but also reflect my growth and the diverse skill set I've developed over the years.

- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and enhances site responsiveness.
- **jQuery**: Simplifies HTML document manipulation and event handling.
- **Bootstrap**: Framework for responsive and mobile-first web design.
- **jQuery Easing Plugin**: Enables advanced smooth scrolling animations.
